      <h2>Short Description</h2>
      <p>
        During my internship at Studio02 GmbH, I worked in the field of software
        development. The main focus was the development of a Bluetooth-based
        client-server system for communication between a mobile app and a
        Raspberry Pi.

      <h2>Performance & Completion</h2>
      <p>
        From the beginning, Mr. Köber demonstrated a strong technical
        understanding as well as an independent and structured working
        approach. He quickly familiarized himself with new topics and
        completed all assigned tasks reliably and in full. The internship
        was successfully completed.
